# Calculator

This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator has a user-friendly interface and is fully responsive, making it accessible on various device screens.

# Features

--> Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.        
--> Clear Functionality: Includes a clear button to reset the calculator for a new calculation.        
--> Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.       
--> Keyboard Support: You can use the keyboard for input in addition to clicking the buttons.

# Technologies Used

--> HTML   
--> CSS    
--> JavaScript

# How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
       git clone https://github.com/rohith1921/CodSoft_03.git

3. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser to start using the calculator.

# How it Works 

--> The user enters numbers and selects an operator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).        
--> The calculator processes the inputs and displays the result on the screen.        
--> The Clear (C) button resets the calculator to its initial state.         
--> The Equals (=) button calculates the result based on the inputs and displays it on the screen.

# Customization 

1. You can update the styles.css file to modify the appearance of the calculator (e.g., button colors, fonts, layout).
2. Modify script.js to extend functionality, such as adding more advanced operations (square roots, percentage, etc.).
3. You can improve UI animations or add sound effects on button clicks for a more interactive experience.


# Future Improvements

1. Implement more advanced features such as memory functions (M+, M-, etc.).
2. Add scientific calculator functionality (e.g., trigonometric operations, square roots).
3. Improve the design with animations or additional themes (light/dark mode toggle).
